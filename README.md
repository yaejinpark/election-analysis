Module 3: PyPoll with Python

## Assignment Overview
Through this project's mock election audit, I was able to fully comprehend how to analyze data from a given CSV file and learn the basics of Python's logical operators. I was given a CSV file with that contains information on voter ID number, voter's county/district, and the name of voter's candidate of choice. My task was to parse through each row of the CSV file (where a single row represented a set of data that contains the voter information mentioned), count the votes, and find which candidate got the most votes and which county had the largest turnout.

The next sections will show and explain my results from finishing the analysis task.

## Election Audit Results
I was able to obtain the desired election results in two forms: output from running the Python code in the terminal and output text file in which I wrote the results of the analysis. The first image shows the output in the terminal, and the second of the text file.

* ![Election Audit Results in the Output Text File](https://github.com/yaejinpark/election-analysis/blob/main/resources/deliverable2.PNG)

As shown in the two images above, the output results are the same content-wise and therefore proves that my analysis Python code worked.
